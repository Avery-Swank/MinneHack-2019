# MinneHack-2019
My team's submission for the Minnesota's MinneHack 2019 Hackathon

# Our Assessment of the Prompt
The prompt that our team was given at the Minnehack was how to improve farmer's livelihood. One of the ways we looked at aleviating stress and costs is this idea of sharing farming equipment. Farming equipment is massive money to spend out of pocket or through loans in order to be able to harvest. Both older farmers need to pay off these loans and younger farmers that want to get started cannot because there is a huge cost barrier to entry.

Our Idea: A web application that shows listings of local farmers that are willing to rent their equipment as a fraction of the cost of buying it.

Thus, Rent-A-Tractor was our idea.

# Software Used
We decided to use AngularJS as our framework for building the front-end with HTML and CSS to easily programm simple web pages and interactions.

We also implemented Google Cloud Platform services and Google Maps Javascript API for visaullizing geolocation information and distance calculations.
